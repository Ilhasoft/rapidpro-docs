IlhaPush Functions

These functions are specifics from IlhaPush and are not found in the Excel, but was provided for convenience.

WORD (text, number, [by_spaces])
Extract the word from a text. If the number defined by a negative number, it is treated as a decrescent count starting at the end of the text. If the by_spaces specified as TRUE, so the function split the text in words just for spaces. On the contrary, the text is split for punctuation characters, for example,

@ (WORD ( “Hello cow-boy”, 2)) will return “cow”
@ (WORD ( “Hello cow-boy”, 2, TRUE)) will return “cow-boy”
@ (WORD ( “Hello cow-boy”, -1)) will return “boy”

WORD_SLICE (text, start [stop], [by_spaces])
Extract a subchain of words that start in the beginner, until, but not including the STOP. If STOP is omitted so the substring will be all words from the beginner to the end of the text. If the stop is a negative number, he is treated as a decrescent count from the end of the text. If by_spaces is specified and this is true, so the function split the text in words just for spaces. On the contrary, the text is split by punctuation characters, for example, 

 @(WORD_SLICE ( “IlhaPush expressions are fun”, 2, 3)) returns the 2º and 3º  words “expressions are”
@ (WORD_SLICE ( “IlhaPush expressions are fun”, 2)) returns “expressions are fun”
@ (WORD_SLICE ( “IlhaPush expressions are fun ”, 1, -2)) returns “IlhaPush expressions”
@ (WORD_SLICE ( “IlhaPush expressions are fun”, -1)) returns “fun”

Problems Solution
Why is only part of my expression evaluated?
If the expression is not the only function or variable call, so you should put them into the brackets to IlhaPush know where it starts and finishes, for example, 

@ (SUM (contact.reports, step.value)) * 2 <- o “* 2” is not evaluated, should be written as: 
@ (SUM (contact.reports, step.value) * 2)
