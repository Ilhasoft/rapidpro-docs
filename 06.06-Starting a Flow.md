If your contacts want to interact into the flow, they should be initialized. A flow can be initialized in different ways:

- You can initialize manually a flow when you want through the box  “Start a flow” on the flow editor;
- Your contacts can initialize a flow receiving a keyword;
- A flow can be started in a future date or a scheduled;
- A flow can be started through a campaign event;
- A flow can be started after a lost call;
- A flow can be started after a received call;
- A flow can be started after receiving a message not handled elsewhere.
