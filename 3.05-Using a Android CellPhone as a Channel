Using an Android Cell Phone as a Channel:

When your RapidPro account sends a message, it notifies your Android Cell Phone. The cell phone will send a message using your local number and name. If someone answers this message, the cell phone will retransmit the message to your RapidPro account. Message packages, by default, each Android is able to send 30 messages per hour. You can send up to 330 messages per hour downloading our App on the Google Play Store.

Buy an Android Cellphone: We recommend to buy a cell phone with just one sim card and dedicate it to process the RapidPro messages.
Get a local sim card: If you do not have a sim card, you should buy one and use any company that you want. We recommend configuring the account to have a data package able to use. But if you feel more comfortable using just the WI-FI, that's no problem. We also recommend that you get a post-paid plan, so you do not need to worry if your cell phone does not have credits.
The Android Push SMS App: You can download the app for free using the Google Play clicking here. As you install the app, a code with 6 characters will be generated, so you should insert it on the website. After that, the cell phone will send and receive the messages to your RapidPro account.
Put your cell phone in a good place: Android cell phone can be used in the hardest environments. You just need to localize a place in your country where you have a constable energy fount and a good signal. You need a wi-fi or GSM connection, but if you have both will be better. The cell phone will be configured automatically if your connection is not working very well.
