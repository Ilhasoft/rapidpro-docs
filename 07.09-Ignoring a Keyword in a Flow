When a contact sends a message that corresponds to a keyword that you defined to start flow, it will be automatically placed into the flow by default. This means that if contact was placed into a flow A and the user responded with a message containing a keyword that starts a flow B, it will leave the flow A and start the flow B. This is useful in situations that you want to permit that your contacts move between the flows using the keywords.

If you want to keep your contacts in flow until they finish or expires, you can configure to ignore the keyword until your contacts have left the first flow.

To say to a flow to ignore triggers and keywords:

1. Go to “flow” and click on the flow that you would like to modify.

2. Click on the gear icon on the top right of the flow editor, after that, click on the option “Edit”.

INSERT A PRINT

3. Select the box “Ignoring Keywords Triggers when you are on this flow”.

INSERT A PRINT

4. Click on Save alterations.
