#### To add a contact to a group: ####

Go to “Contacts” guide, Click on the box on the left of the contact that you would like to insert in a group, after that, click on the groups' icon located on the top of the contacts to select a group or create a new one.

#### Using a Flow: ####

You can add a contact to a group or remove it with a flow action **“Add a contact to a group”** or **“Remove a contact from a group”**. 
On the example below, we are using an action **“Split by Contact Field”** to direct the contacts living in Alagoas to the group  “Alagoas”.

We can do this splitting our contacts using the option “State”. The option **“has any of these words”** allows us to create a rule to locate contacts with the “State” field containing any of these words: “Maceio”, “Arapiraca”, “Maragogi”, etc. in the category “Alagoas”.
