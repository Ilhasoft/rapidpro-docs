Besides the voice and SMS, RapidPro allows you to apply our exclusive flow to interact with direct messages on Twitter. The Twitter flows are useful for greeting new followers or start a pre-existing form. They also allow you to get involved with constituent or clients that are actives in a platform that serves 320 millions of actives users monthly, of which 80% access the platform through a mobile telephone. Programs as U-Report from UNICEF, for example, use the Twitter flows to divulge the researches between youths from various successful countries

How it works - Manager your 
Ilhapush followers allows you to connect your Twitter account, that constitutes a channel. When connected, anybody who sends a message to your Twitter account will appear as a contact in your ilhapush account and can interact with any of your flows. Ilhapush provides a standard field that stores the twitter that your contact talks with.

All direct messages received are stored automatically by ilhapush, and you will be able to send a direct message to the contacts using your twitter if your account is enabled to receive a direct message to anybody. For example, if a follower sends a direct message containing a keyword trigger that starts one of the flows, they will receive an answer as they would do via SMS. Alternatively, you can create a trigger that sends a flow or a message to anybody that you want to follow. This is how we structure our ilhapush account.
