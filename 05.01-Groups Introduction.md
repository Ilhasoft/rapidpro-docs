Contacts groups allow you to segment your contacts in groups based on their attributes and answers. The contacts can be located in various groups, and you can create how many groups as you need.

In the flow, the contacts can be moved from or to groups using Add a Contact and Remove Contact buttons. Contacts Groups can be referenced using the variable @contact.groups.
