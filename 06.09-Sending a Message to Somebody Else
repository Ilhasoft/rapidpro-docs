You can add an action on your flow to avoid sending a message to somebody who is not an active contact on this step. For example, this action can be used for:

Other contacts progress warmings on a flow;
Contact response warming for an answer in a flow;
Link a contact with a team member able to talk directly on your own cell phone.

Forwarding Messages
On the example below, a flow was configured to forward a response to a contact from a specific question to the members' team:

INSERT A PRINT

On the messages above, we use variables to represent the following information about each contact on this step:
@step.contact.name: Represents the contacts name activated on the flow;
@flow.estado: Represents the State chosen for the contact on the “Wait for Estado” step;
@step.contact.email: Represents the user email.

@Step.contact vs. @contact - Notice that there are two ways to do a contact reference in the fields into the flow.
@contact - Refer the contact who is going to receive a message. On most of the cases this is an active contact – the person who responses are being manipulated into the flow. To Send a Message to Someone Else, @contact refer to a contact or a contact group that the message is going to be sent.
@Step.contact - refer the contact who sent the last processed message on the flow. Most of the cases, this is also an active contact. To use Send a Message, @step.contact e @contact  are the same contact. To use Send a Message to Someone Else, @step.contact refer the contact who reach the Send a Message to Someone Else on the flow, then, sending the message.

Look here an example:

INSERT A PRINT

When a message is created by Send a Message to Someone Else is sent to Nelson, @contact.first_name will be replaced for the Nelson first name. @Step.contact.name and @step.contact.email will be replaced for the name and contacts email through the flow.
