#### How it works ####

Let's say that you are executing a study about adhesion therapy that the participants are invited to indicate how they are feeling every day - healthy or sick:

Adding the action Add label after the RuleSet “Wait for Health” allows to filter responses that pass for a particular category. On the example above, we added an Add Label action in a branch that passes by the “Sick” category. So, only the responses registered as “Sick” will be select. You can see the messages, nav to the messages guide and click on the label “Sick”.

#### Adding a Label ####

Add a label is so easy as create an ActionSet, or add an ActionSet to an ActionSet existent. You can choose an existent label or create a new using the Add Label dialog box.
