Types of channels and types of contact addresses

INSERT A PRINT

The table above maps each type of channel with their type of contacts address correspondents. Each contact can have different addresses of the same type (for example, multiple numbers of phone number). The contacts address priority will show which type of channel will send messages for a contact. If you have a lot of different channels of the same type connected to your account, the last channel with an initialized contact will be prioritized. The contacts can be connected to a relationship with a specific channel (they will receive messages just from this channel) under three conditions:

You have a lot of different channels of the same type connected to your account.
The priority of the address contacts corresponds to a type of channels (for example, phone number) that has multiple channels (for example, different phone numbers).
