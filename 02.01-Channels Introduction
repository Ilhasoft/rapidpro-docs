It processes virtual numbers and codes that are easily connected on your Push account through integration with the platform. Twilio, Plivo, Nexmo are examples of globals aggregators (the can answer a lot of countries), Clickatell and Zevia are examples of locals aggregators. We recommend searching local aggregators before connect with a global aggregator (the price of local aggregators usually are cheaper than global aggregators).

SMS: We recommend to buy a free virtual number by Twilio to implement the SMS service on USA and Canada, to more locals we recommend to buy a conventional number. This channel is recommended to medium and high flows because the messages are forwarded in their highest frequency.

Android Phone (SMS): The Android Phone channel uses our Android Free App to transform your phone in a message transmitter to your Push account. When your Push account sends a message, your cell phone will be notified. The cell phone will send a message using your local number and your name.

Telegram

External API
The API channel allows sending and receiving messages through external suppliers (there are more APIs not listed when the user wants to add a channel). This could be a chat/external message service or an aggregator not listed (although we are inclined to integrate with the case have a compromise of at least 100.000 credits).
