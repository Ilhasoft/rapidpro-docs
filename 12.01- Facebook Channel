Besides the voice and SMS, IlhaPush allows you to apply our flows system to send the flows directly to the Facebook inbox. The flows to Facebook are useful to interact with the user that likes the company page. They allow you to get involved with the clients that are actives on a platform that serves more than 1,3 billions of actives users monthly. The U-Report, a UNICEF program, for example, uses the flows to Facebook to disclose the researches between the youth with different countries successfully.
