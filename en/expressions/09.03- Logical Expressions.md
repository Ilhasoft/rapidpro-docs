The logical expressions is an expression that evaluates as TRUE or FALSE. This expression can use some operators: 
- Equals (=);
- Different (<>);
- More than (>);
- More or equal (>=);
- Lesser (<);
- and lesser or equals (<=).

**For example:**

- @(Contact.age> 18)

Notice that when you compare the text values, equals (=) and different (<>), the operators don't differ Upper and Lower case.
