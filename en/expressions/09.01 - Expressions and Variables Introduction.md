## Expressions and variables intro

By now you may know that building a flow is connecting a collection of actions altogether and it intends to gather some result. That's what variables are for, store flow's step values and persist data.
For example, the *Wait for response* below will generate a flow variable named *name* as the contact reply to it. Additionally, the variable will be used to save the data into *Name* contact's field.

*Variables* and *Expressions* starts with the `@` symbol. Expressions are modeled within specific syntaxes and typing `@` will load a list of 10 possibilities. You can advance to more complex expressions by typing `@(` - called *Functions*.

After selecting the *Expression*, it's possible to explore its advanced features too. Select one and hitting *Enter* or *Tab* will load a list of all available *functions* for each expression type. On the example below you can see that `@contact` has a lot more options than just showing the contact's name:

When using flow's expressions it's also possible to specify the metadata you're aiming. See the following example:

`@results.gender.category` returns the category that the contacts answer was located;

`@results.gender.value` returns the complete response answer from a contact;

`@results.gender.input` returns the time when the contact message was received by the channel.

Each expression represents the value when contact is active on the flow. If you type an incorrect expression, the message will show itself.
