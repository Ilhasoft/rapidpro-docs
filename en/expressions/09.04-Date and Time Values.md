The platform emulates almost all operators available in the Excel for date and time.

**For example, to add 7 days to a date, you just need to sum 7 to the actual data.**

- See you next week on @(date.today + 7)

**To remember a passed date you just need subtract the days.**

- Last week was @(date.today - 7)

**To add or subtract months use the expression EDATE.**

- The next meeting will be @(EDATE(date.today, 1))

**To alter the date and time value, add or subtract the function TIME result, for example.**

- 2 hours and 30 minutes from now will be @(date.now + TIME (2, 30, 0))
