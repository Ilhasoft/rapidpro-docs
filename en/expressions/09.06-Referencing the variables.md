## Contact's Variables

`@contact` rules represent contact's field values, individually for each respective contact.

The following `expressions` can be used in a flow to extract contact's data:

  - `@contact` or `@contact.name` - Contact's full name if present, if not, contact's ID. eg.: "Ben Haggerty".

  - `@contact.first_name` - Contact's first name, parsed from contact's full name stored at `name` if present, if not, phone number or contact's ID. eg.: "Ben".

  - `@contact.display` - Contact's full name if present, if not, contact's URN. eg.: "Ben Haggerty".
  - `@contact.fields` - Contact's field and respecive values.
  - `@contact.urn` - Contact's full URN address.
  - `@contact.language` - Contact's primary language in ISO code 639-2.
  - `@contact.created_on` - Contact's creation date in timestamp.
  - `@contact.groups` - Contact's groups membership.
  - `@contact.urns` - Contact's full URN address in array for all workspace's channels.
  - `@contact.uuid` - Contact's UUID.
  - `@contact.channel` - Contact's preferred channel name.

While `@contact` refers to the active contact that is receiving the message. But using the *Send somebody else a message*, `@contact` refers to another contact that will receive the message (you will also see it's possible to set a contact's group).

## Flow Variables

Flow variables refer to values collected in each flow. `@results` variables just inform the values collected by the flow as they are in use. This allows you to refer to the values previously collected or update contact's fields with a value sent by a contact. The default variable name matches the result name from the flow step.

When you type `@results` in a step, you will see a drop-down menu with a list of variables on the flow that will be filled automatically.

## Examples

Below we will register a simple client using an e-mail, phone number, and age.

The *Wait for Phone Number* step collects answers from "…What is your phone number?" *Send Message* saving the response in a flow variable named `phone_number`:

Contact's responses can be referred to as`@results.[prefix]`, in the case of the phone number we can use `@results.phone_number` saving to the respective contact's field.

See some possibilities that you can use to filter flow's variables according to your strategy. `[variable name]` is a reserved space for any result present on the flow.

`@results` - All flow variables collected until this point. eg.: "Name: Jane, Age: 32";

`@results.[variable name]` - The collected value. eg.: `@results.age`, "32";

`@results.[variable name].category` - The category is evaluated for. eg.: "valid phone";

`@results.[variable name].value` - The entire text is evaluated using a Rule Set. eg.: "I am 32 years old";

`@results.[variable name].input` - The date and time when a flow value was collected. eg.: "02/04/2016 19:11:50" (according to the date/time format).

## Channel's expressions

`@contact.channel` refers to a channel a message is flowing through. For example, if a contact sends a message through Facebook, the variable `@contact.channel` will be referred to like a Facebook account ID.

`@contact.channel.name` - the name of the contact's preferred channel. eg.: "my Facebook page".

`@contact.channel.uuid` - the UUID of the contact's preferred channel. eg.: "6b85e123-c717-49f7-951e-1ab5a08961a0"

`@contact.channel.address` - the address of the contact's preferred channel. eg.: "Facebook (316455289259123)"

## Date' expressions

The date's expressions refer to the timezone option set on the workspace settings. Observe that the variable format depends on the data template configuration.

`@(now())` - The actual date and time in timestamp template. eg.: "2019-12-05T22:07:42.583440+03:00"

> Use `@(format_datetime(now()))` to get date and time. eg.: "05-12-2019 22:09"

`@(format_date(today()))` - The actual date. eg.: "05-12-2019"

`@(format_date(datetime_add(now(), 1, "D")))` - Tomorrow's  date. eg.: "06-12-2019"

`@(format_date(datetime_add(now(), -1, "D")))` - Yesterday's date. eg.: "04-12-2019"

## Webhook expression

`@webhook` refers to variables extracted from an external application through a webhook. It will always return the parsed JSON payload of the last webhook call, if necessary to call for previous steps webhook you must use the respective variable name for that webhook.
