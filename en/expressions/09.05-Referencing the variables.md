## Flow Variables ##
@flow variables refer to values collected in each RuleSet into a flow. @flow variables just inform the values collected by the flow that they are called. This allows you to refer to the values previously collected or contacts actualization fields with a value sent by a contact. The variable name will correspond with the result name from the collected RuleSet.

When you type @flow in a step, you will see a drop-down menu with a list of variables on the flow that will be filled automatically.

**For example:**

In the example below we will register a simple client using an email, phone number, and age.

The Wait for Phone Number RuleSet Collects answers from “…What is your phone number?” Send Message using an opened response rule and save the resulting values for a field flow named “Phone Number”:

The responses from your contacts can be referred with @flow.[prefix], in the case of the phone number we can use @flow.phonenumber to save the contacts phone number in a new field named “Phone Number”.

Here is an extensive list that you can use to filer the flow variables according to your necessities [variable name], is a reserved space for any result presenting in the flow.

**@flow** - All flow variables collected until this point, for example, “Name: Jane, Age: 32”;

**@flow.[variable name]** – The collected value, for example, @flow.age, “32”;

**@flow.[variable name].category** - The category is evaluated for, for example, “Valide”;

**@flow.[variable name].text** - The entire text is evaluated using a Rule Set, for example, “I am 32 years old”;

**@flow.[variable name].time** - The date and time when a flow value was collected, for example, “02/04/2016 19:11:50” (according to the date/time format).

## Referencing a contact into the flow ##
There are two ways to reference contact fields in the flow:

**@contact** - Refer the contact that is receiving the message. On most of the cases, this is an active contact. Use the “ Send the Message to Someone”, @contact refer to the contact or contact group that will receive the message.

**@step.contact** – Refer to the contact that sends the last message processed on the flow. On most of the cases, this is an active contact. Using the “Send an Action Response SMS”, @step.contact and @contact are the same contacts. Using the “Send a Message to Someone”, @step.contact refer to the contact that received the message from “Send a Message to Someone” in the flow, through triggers.

## Channel Variable(@Channel) ##
@Channel variables refer to a channel through a received message. For example, if a contact sends a message through an Android channel connected to his account, the variable @channel will be referred to a number attributed to the SIM card.

**@channel** - the phone number that received the last message from the contact, in a legible format, for example, “(206) 555 1212”;

**@channel.name** - the channel name (that can be edited clicking on the channel) ex: “Nexus 5”;

**@channel.tel** – the phone number that received the last contact message, in a legible format, for example, “(206) 555 1212”;

**@channel.tel_e164** – the E164 format from a phone number that received the last message from a contact, for example, “+12065551212”.

## Data Variable ##
@date variables are referred to time values according to the time zone attributed to your account. Observe that the variable format @date depends on the format data configuration.

**@date** - The actual date and time, for example, “2014/02/05 20:08”

**@date.now** - The actual date and time, for example, “2014/02/05 20:08”

**@date.today** - The actual date, for example, “2014/02/05”

**@date.tomorrow** - The tomorrow date, for example, “2015/03/05”

**@date.yesterday** - The yesterday date, for example, “2014/01/05”

## Extras Variables ##
@extra refers to variables extracted from an external application through a webhook, or if the flow is started for a Start Another Flow action, the flow variables associated with the contact on the previous flow, for example, @Extra.flow.response_1. If Start Someone Else in a Flow action was used to start flow, @extra can be also used to make references to previous contact fields (with @step variables).
