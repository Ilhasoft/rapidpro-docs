The expressions syntax are modeled as they are used in Microsoft Excel™ formula, although all expressions start with “@” symbol. When written, the symbol “@” will unleash a conclusion dialog box that lists and explain each function.

INSERT A PRINT

Simple Syntax: Are used to call unique values, for example:
	Hello @contact, have you accessed the @flow.support, is it right?
 
The expression also can be called functional, for example:   
	Hello @(UPPER(contact.first_name))
Functional names do not differ the Upper and Lower case. On the example below, using UPPER will return the contact name in the Upper Case.

RapidPro recognizes a lot of Excel functions, let's list them:
Advanced Syntax: Are used to build more complex expressions using a syntax similar with Excel formula, for example:
	Hello @(PROPER(contact), Are you @(YEAR(NOW())) - flow.year_born) years old? Is it right?

Expressions also can include a arithmetic calc with sum (+),  subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) and exponential (^):
	The result is @(1 + (1-3) * 4 / 5ˆ6).
  
Notice that, the expression is between parenthesis to say to RapidPro where the expression finishes.
You can also use concatenation operators (join) (&), por exemplo:
	Hello @(contact.first_name & " " & contact.last_name).
