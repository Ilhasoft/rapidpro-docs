## Add a contact to a group through a flow:
1. You can add a contact to a group or remove it with a flow action "Add a contact to a group" or "Remove a contact from a group". In the example below, we are using an action "Split by Contact Field" to direct the contacts living in Alagoas to the group "Alagoas".

2. We can do this splitting our contacts using the option "State". The option "has any of these words" allows us to create a rule to locate contacts with the "State" field containing any of these words: "Maceio", "Arapiraca", "Maragogi", etc. in the category "Alagoas".
