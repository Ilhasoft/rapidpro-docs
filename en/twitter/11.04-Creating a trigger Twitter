You can create a trigger to start a flow every time that you are followed for a contact. Access the guide “Triggers” and create a new “Start a flow after be followed for a new contact” trigger. Select your Twitter channel, and the flow wants to start to the user and click on the “Create a Trigger” button.

 
As you finished your Twitter channel will be ready to use.
