Besides the voice and SMS, this platform allows you to apply our exclusive flow to interact by direct messages on Twitter. The Twitter flows are useful for greeting new followers or start a pre-existing form. They also allow you to get involved with constituent or clients that are actives in a platform that serves 320 million active users monthly, of which 80% access the platform through a mobile telephone. Programs as U-Report from UNICEF, for example, use the Twitter flows to divulge the researches between youths from various successful countries.

#### How does it work?

Manager your followers allow you to connect your Twitter account, which constitutes a channel. When connected, anybody who sends a message to your Twitter account will appear as a contact in your account and can interact with any of your flows. This platform provides a default field that stores the twitter that your contact talks with.
 
All direct messages received are stored automatically, and you will be able to send a direct message to the contacts using your twitter if your account is enabled to receive a direct message from anybody. For example, if a follower sends a direct message containing a keyword trigger that starts one of the flows, they will receive an answer as they would do via SMS. Alternatively, you can create a trigger that sends a flow or a message to anybody that you want to follow. This is how we structure our account.
