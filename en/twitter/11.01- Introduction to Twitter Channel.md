#### How does it work? ####

Manager your followers allow you to connect your Twitter account, that constitutes a channel. When connected, anybody who sends a message to your Twitter account will appear as a contact in your account and can interact with any of your flows. This platform provides a default field that stores the twitter that your contact talks with.

All direct messages received are stored automatically, and you will be able to send a direct message to the contacts using your twitter if your account is enabled to receive a direct message from anybody. For example, if a follower sends a direct message containing a keyword trigger that starts one of the flows, they will receive an answer as they would do via SMS. Alternatively, you can create a trigger that sends a flow or a message to anybody that you want to follow. This is how we structure our account.
