Telegram is a service based on instantaneous messages cloud - similar to WhatsApp and WeChat - focused in velocity, opening, and security. It is an open-source and encrypted end-to-end app, which means that all sent and received data via telegram cannot be decipher when intercepted by the ISP, networking manager or third parties.

#### Why telegram?
Exists 5 important reasons that make Telegram our first choice to messages based on the cloud:

1. Differently, of the most chat apps based on cloud, Telegram provides an open API that stimulates the integration and development.
2. The telegram values of opening and security accord with our values, allowing us to provide an encrypted channel for organizations to share information.
3. It is totally free.

**How does it work?**

Your Telegram channel will be represented by a bot. Telegram Bots are special accounts that will work as an interface for the flows and messages that will be sent by the platform. Bots differ from the standard accounts because of it's: 

1. Don't have online status or the last message seen, the interface shows the label 'bot'.
2. The usernames always finish in 'bot' (for example,@YouNameBot, @YorName_bot).
3. Act as a simple interface for a Telegram API.

The telegram bots allow creating custom tools that provide warnings, forecasts, translations, and different services.

#### Broadcast Message

Normally the Telegram does not provide a method to send broadcast messages or notifications.
A bot did not connect to the Platform can not start conversations with new users. A new user should add them to a group or send a message, they can use the [link](telegram.me/~~number=plural<bot_username>), or search the user name to find your bot. But, when a bot is connected to your account, your telegram contacts will become contacts on the platform, this allows you to boost our diffusion functionality to start conversations and send notifications easily.
