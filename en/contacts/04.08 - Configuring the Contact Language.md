**To define the contact language preferences through the "Contacts" guide:**

**Notice that:** 
1. The standard contact language field represents the favorite language that will be visible through the path: 
 - Go to contacts guide
 - Click on contact 
 - Click on the gear icon
 - Select Edit. 
 - The language preference can be referred to using the variable @contact.language, returning your ISO 639-2/b standard nomenclature (Spanish become 'spa').

2. You will need to translate your flows in each language that was added to your account.

#### Using a Flow
You can get the same result in a big scale creating a flow that contains the action Define Language, after that, add the contacts or groups that you want to modify the preferences

##### Using an Imported Contact:
You can add a column called "Language" containing the language code, for example, 639-2/B ISO ('spa', for Spanish) for a contact importation to define the contacts favorites languages. Notice that all additional languages should be adding to your account through the account page.
