Importing contacts allows you to add an entire group to the platform using a simple XLS (MS Excel) spreadsheet. The contacts will be placed in a new contact group that corresponds to a spreadsheet imported name. Notice that, you should connect a channel to your account to import contacts. 

**To import contacts, import an XLS spreadsheet containing:**
- Address's column corresponds to each address contacts and can contain (the number columns contains the phone number using the E164 format, and/or a Telegram column containing the Telegram identification, and/or a Twitter column for each contact, and/or email column). When imported, the platform will show the contacts phone number without the country code.
- The name's column contains the first name and the surname of each contact.
- (Conditional) A UUID column contains the identification universally exclusive for each contact that you want to import. This column can replace the name column, it is necessary to import a spreadsheet with the intention to add a new address or kind of address.
- (Optional) The language column represents the main language containing ISO 639-2 standard nomenclature to classify the included languages.
- (Optional) Any added column number corresponds to a custom attribute* (contacts field) containing the contacts value fields. Observe the column names are limited to 36 characters and don't support special characters.

*Notice that, when you want to import a date value to the platform but without a time value, it will attribute a 00:00 time value. Although to add manually just a data value to each contact field, the platform will replace the correspondent time value with the time moment that you updated the field.*

**Importing types of addresses:**

The contacts can be imported with different addresses, but just one address for each type:

- The contacts addresses can be added through an importation if the UUID column contains contacts UUID(s). The UUIDs can be obtained through a contacts exportation or using a contacts list on the API Explorator:

- Exported contacts contained the UUIDs for their contacts, names, addresses and custom fields. To exports, your contacts, go to Contacts guide, go to configure menu icon and select "Export".
