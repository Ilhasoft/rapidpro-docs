#### Operators
On the consult demonstrated above, there is a reference to a contact field called "Age" and using the operators "more or equals to " "> =" and "minor or equals to" '<=' to specify the wanted characteristics of the contacts that you are looking for. Look that, with the contact fields that contain two or more words, the spaces need to be replaced for underline, for example, id_number = 409328.

#### Variables
You can use 'OR' to combine two or more contact field value, and 'AND' to filter for contacts fields. For example:
(City = "Maceió" or City = "Aracaju"), will return just contacts that the  'City' value is "Maceió" or "Aracaju";
(City = "Maceió" and Gender = "Male"), will return just contacts that the  'City'  value is "Maceió" and "Gender" value is "Male".

#### Fields Type
The text values containing a lot of words should be placed between quotation marks, for example, city = "São Paulo", while the operators are like "> =" only works with numerical numbers or date/time.
