When the contact field is created, the default value is null, at least the field was imported from a pre-existing value. To alter a newly created field value, you can update it using this action or editing a contact field value using the contact’s guide. For example, when a new phone number sends a message to a channel connected to your account, a new contact will be created with a null value in the name field and null values for each added contact’s field. The new contact will be identifiable by your phone number until that other values are updated.

Use a contact actualization action to:

Create a new contact field and update its value for each contact on this action;

Update the existing contact field for every contact reach this action;

Variables and Expressions
The contact fields can be updated with a fixed value, expressions or variables:

@flow - Is the variable attributed to the Rule Set result. Can include .Text (for example, @flow.response_1.text, the complete entry text message sent by the contact), .Map (for example, @flow.response_1.category, the category where the message was sent) or .time (for example, @flow.response_1.time, the time when the entry message was received);

@date - Used to call date values (@date.now, @date.yesterday, @date.today, @date.tomorrow);

@channel - The channel that received the message (@channel.name, @channel.tel, @channel.tel_e164);

@step - The contact who sent the last message processed by the flow. In most cases, this is also the active contact (@step.value).

@extra - References extracted from an external application through a webhook, or, if the flow is initialized for a "Start Another Flow", the flow variables associated as a contact working on a previous flow, for example, @Extra.flow.response_1. A expression, example @(HOUR (NOW ())).
