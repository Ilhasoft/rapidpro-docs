You can communicate with your contacts by using the “Send a Response message” in the old editor or the “Send the contact a message” in the new editor. These actions will allow you to send messages to your contacts within your flow. 

**Note that these actions are the same and have the same functionalities but with deferent designs as follow:**

1. Send a response message - old flow editor.

**Characters Limites** 

One message has 160 characters limit, if your message exceeds this it will be divided in two messages. There is a counter below the dialog box showing how many characters you still have. On the example below, the message has 134 characters.
