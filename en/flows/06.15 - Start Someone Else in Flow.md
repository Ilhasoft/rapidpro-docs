Use Start Someone Else in a Flow to put a contact or a group into a flow when a contact reaches this step. 

#### Creating a New Contact

This action can be used to create a totally new contact. On the example below the contact in the "patient" flow is being invited to present the patient’s name and phone number. After the information was collected we used the "Start Someone Else in a flow" action to unleash the new flow "Create a New Patient". 
A new contact with the standard field (name and phone number) will be created in this new flow. Name and phone number are going to be filled using an Update the contact action using the results collected in the previous flow (patient)

In summary, the first flow collects the patient information, while the second flow updates a contact profile for this patient.

The contact name and the phone number are collected, then this information is sent to "Create Contacts" flow.

When using the new editor you will follow the same steps mentioned above, the only difference is that you will found "Start Somebody Else in a flow" instead of "Start Someone Else in a Flow".
