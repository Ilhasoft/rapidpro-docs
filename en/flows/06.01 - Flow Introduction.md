**Flow definition**

A flow is a set of actions or steps organized in a flowchart, these actions are applied to your contacts when they enter the flow. In the old editor, the steps are composed of ActionSets and RuleSets; for the new editor, these steps are called Actions and SplitActions.

#### Action Sets - Old Editor

**The "ActionSet" represents some operations done in your flow. Essentially, these are commands that allow you:**
- Send an SMS answer "SMS response" (standard to "send a message": action – will send a message to the actives contacts to reach this flows step);
- SMS to somebody else;
- Add a label to a Message;
- Update the contact  (with a value received from an answer, for example);
- Add a contact to a group;
- Remove contact from a group;
- Send an Email;
- Set the contact's main language;
- Start another flow;
- Start someone else in a flow;

Action commands comprehend actions executed immediately, on a top-down order:

#### RuleSet - Old Editor

**Rule Sets are connection points in a flow. They are conditionals declarations that allow you to direct your contacts by using:**
- A received or recorded message
- A contact field
- A flow variable
- A form field
- An expression

**RuleSet Anatomy**

Rule Sets comprehend 5 entries that allow you to build a powerful conditional instruction:

1. The type of rule set that you would like to build:
 - "Wait for response": Wait for the user answer, after that, evaluate according to the created rules.
 - "Call WebHook": Call a URL, passing for the flow context* and save a JSON answer for reference using the @extra variable.
 - "Split by flow field": executes the answer rules collected by a set of previews rules referred to using the @flow.variable[Variable-name], for example, @Flow.cidade.
 - "Split by contact field": Executes the answer rules saved in a contact field (name, phone number, etc.), referred using @contact.variable[variable name], for example, @contact.State.
 - "Split by expression": Execute answer rules using the expression result, as @(REMOVE_FIRST_WORD (step.value)), it includes a function that removes the first word of the last received message, represented by @step.variable.value. Expressions can include only one variable, only one function or a combination of variables and functions.
 - "Split by message form": Execute answers rules about a value split by a delimiter, for example, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 (+ is the delimiter, while 1 is the first value, 2 is the second value, 3 is the third value, etc.).

2. Depending on the type of command selected, this is the value that the rules are going to be evaluated. This value, requires an operator, represents a variable or an expression. On the ruleset on the picture below, "If the message.." indicates that the operator is @step.value or a received message.

3. "Response Rules": evaluate the selected operator. Response Rules are executed from left to right. The first rule correspondent starts. The platform combines one word per time and just one individually rule on the original string order.

4. The answer rules value(s) will try to correspond to the operator. Looking at the example above, we create a rule set that tries to correspond to the cities from Alagoas. Using the "Wait for response" rule set the answer selected "has any of these words", the received answers will be placed on the category named  "Alagoas" if this corresponds to some listed word. This allows us to place the answer "I live in Maceió" on the category "Alagoas" because the word "Maceió" is contained on the rule. Notice that flow will always be correspondent at least one rule.

5. The responses from your contacts.

6. The name given to the created variable "flow" is filled for a ruleset. On the example above, the rule command will save the evaluation result for the flow variable @flow.state.

When someone is at this point in the flow, wait for an answer. If the answer contains any of these words -. 'Maragogi', 'Arapiraca', 'Maceio', etc. – classify as Alagoas on the flow variable 'State'.

*Flow context comprehends the available variables on a determined flow. These are the flow variables used by action commands, but you can add contacts variables associated with a contact used through a flow, or data obtained from an external font through a webhook.*

#### Flow members
Flows are exclusive spaces where your contacts will get in and get out.  When a contact is inside a flow, he becomes an active member of the until the contact comes out from it. The Passage through a flow from entry to exit is all activity that happens midway and constitutes a "run". Runs and activities that happen within a flow are displayed in flow results. Flow "runs" flow can be listed and started externally through an API.

The active members in a flow are represented by the blue button located on the top left of each ruleset.

#### Getting in a Flow
**You can put them in a flow using the button "Start the Flow" on the flows editor;**
- They can put contacts on a flow started by a campaign event;
- They can start a flow through a trigger.
- A contact started a flow calling to a telephone number on its channel.
- A flow is started by a missed call;
- A contact started by a flow through a message send for your channel that is not processed in another place.

#### Getting out a flow
**A contact will get out of a flow when:**
- Completes a flow by finishing the last step;
- Passes for a step that don't have a continuation;
- Passes for an action that starts another flow;
- If the flow participation expired after a determined period of  contact inactivity

#### Members Rules Flow
The contacts will interact with flows one-by-one. If contact is simultaneously located in more than one flow, the answers will be processed in the most recent flow. While a contact is active in a flow, the answers are processed exclusively for the active flow until the contact goes out of this flow. 

**The Best Edition Practices**
1. Keep the proportion of 1:1 Answer/Message

2.	Do not build flows horizontally; the flow editor has a limited capacity for horizontal flows.  We recommend you to build flows in a  vertical direction;

3.	Segment your flows if  they are too large. Consider dividing it in other flows by using the rule command "Start another flow".
