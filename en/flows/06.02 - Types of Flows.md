**Text Message (Messaging)**

Text Message is the default flow type since every channel type includes necessarily the text-based messaging functionality. Text Message Flows could be sent through an Android channel, a virtual number, or a social media platform like Facebook, Twitter or Viber.

**Telephone Calls (Voice flows)**

If you have a voice-enabled channel connected to your account (for example, a Twilio voice-enabled virtual number), you can create an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) when you go to the dialog box "Create a Flow". IVR flows allow you to apply flows logical messages based invoice to be sent through calls. Check our IVR section for more information about URA flows.
