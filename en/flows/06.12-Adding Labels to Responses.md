## How it works ##
Let's say that you are executing a study about adhesion therapy that the participants are invited to indicate how they are feeling every day - healthy or sick. Adding the action Add label after the RuleSet “Wait for Health” allows to filter responses that pass for a particular category.

## Adding a Label ##
Add a label is so easy as create an ActionSet, or add an ActionSet to an ActionSet existent. You can choose an existent label or create a new using the Add Label dialog box.
