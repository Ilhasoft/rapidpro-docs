Labeling the messages allows you to classify the responses according to a specific subject and organize your workspace.

## How It Works
Imagine you are executing a study about welfare and the participants are invited to indicate how they are feeling every day - healthy or sick. You can label their responses by creating a label on the message guide or within your flow using "Add a label message" in the old editor or "Label the incoming message" in the new editor. 

Learn bellow how to create a label on the message guide:

1. Click on the messages guide;
