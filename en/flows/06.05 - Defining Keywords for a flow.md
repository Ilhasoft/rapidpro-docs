You can attribute keyword(s) to a flow to allow your contacts to start it by using the criteria you set. A keyword is the first word in an incoming message.

#### To attribute a keyword in a flow:

1. Go to the "flow"

4. Add a keyword(s). Notice that this option is not case sensitive (doesn't differ upper and lower case), for example, Register and register are processed in the same way.

#### Ignoring triggers

You can select the "Ignore triggers" option to avoid that your contacts start another flow. When this option is selected, a contact cannot start a new flow if he sends a message containing the keyword attributed to this specific flow.
