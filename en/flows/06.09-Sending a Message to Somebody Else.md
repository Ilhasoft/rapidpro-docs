You can send messages to contacts that are not active in a particular flow by using the “Send a message to somebody else” in the old editor or the “Send somebody else a message” in the new editor.

**How it Works**

Imagine you have a contact that want to book a room on a hotel. The contact is responding the “Reservation Flow” then he is an active contact in this flow.  At particular step, the flow will check if there are places on the Hotel. You can use “Send a message to somebody else” Action to broadcast a message to the Hotel staff (contact not active in the flow) to check availability. Check the example bellow done in the new flow editor.
