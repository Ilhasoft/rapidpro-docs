**The dialog box “Create a Flow” will appear, so you can:**
- Define the flows name;
- Attribute keyword triggers;
- Specify how much time the contacts still inactive on the flow before being deleted;
- Select the type of flow that you would like to create;
- Define the language that you will edit it.

When the adequate attributes are defined, click on the “Create” button to go to the flow editor.

**Best Edition Practices**
1. Build Horizontally
While the flow builds, we recommend drawing your flow vertically. The flow editor is projected to support the horizontal movement until a point but will permit the vertical movement indefinitely.
2. Segment your Flow
If the flow that you want to build is large, consider dividing it in various flows using a rule set to start other flow action.
