**The dialog box “Create a Flow” will appear, so you can:**
- Define the flows name;
- Attribute keyword triggers;
- Specify how much time a contact can stay inactive on the flow before being deleted;
- Select the type of flow that you would like to create;
- Define the language that you will edit it.

When the adequate attributes are defined, click on the “Create” button to go to the flow editor.

**Best Edition Practices**
1. Keep the proportion of 1:1 Answer/Message. 
2. Do not build flows horizontally; the flow editor has a limited capacity for horizontal flows.  We recommend you to build flows in a  vertical direction 
3. Segment your flows if  they are too large. Consider dividing it in other flows by using “Start another flow”.
