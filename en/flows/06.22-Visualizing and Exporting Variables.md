They complete the flow;
Start another flow through Start Another Flow Action, or;
Expires the flow after an inactive period (you determine it).

Depending the selected configurations that you selected on the dialog box ‘Resulting Exportation Flow’,  the XLS exported will contain 3 guides:

**Runs:** A contact can pass through a flow more than once, so the guide Runs exhibit how many times the contact passed by.
Contacts: The contacts guide show the last run values (and the last value for each step on the flow, and what can been visited more than once, if the contact has never been redirected for him).

**Messages:** On the messages, guide is showed all send messages from or to your contacts flow. It provides the message direction (IN/OUT), text, date, and contact information.

Each response is presented in three columns - Category, value, and text:

- The column Category contains the category where the contact response was located according to the response rules attributed. As the message above indicates, any answer containing 1, y, sim, s or yes is classified as Yes.

- The value column contains the value catched for a response rule. If the received message read “Yes or No”, the collected value will be Yes because the response contained a valued correspondent to a word that you specified using the Has Any of These Words. In the other way, if a contact answer just with one of the words specified by the response rule (Yes), the value and text columns will contain the same value.

- The text column contains the complete response text, for example, “Yes, I am.”
