You can send messages to contacts that are not active in a particular flow by using the "Send a message to somebody else" in the old editor or the "Send somebody else a message" in the new editor.  

1. "Send a message to somebody else" - Old editor

**How it Works**

Imagine you have a contact that wants to book a room at a hotel. The contact is responding to the "Reservation Flow" then he is an active contact in this flow.  In a particular step, the flow will check if there are places at the Hotel. You can use "Send a message to somebody else" Action to broadcast a message to the Hotel staff (contact not active in the flow) to check availability. Check the example bellow done in the new flow editor.
