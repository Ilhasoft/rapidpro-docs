If your contacts want to interact with a flow it should be initialized. 

 A flow can be initialized in different ways:

1. You can initialize manually a flow whenever you want by clicking on the box "Start a flow" on the flow editor:

 ![](/img/flow/startflow.png)

2. Your contacts can initialize a flow writing keyword set by you;
3. A flow can be started in a future date or a scheduled;
4. A flow can be started through a campaign event;
5. A flow can be started after a missed call;
6. A flow can be started after a received call;
7. A flow can be started after receiving a message not handled elsewhere.
