## Creating a Pipeline Email

This action is a simple way to send a question from a contact to a team member. You just need to create a flow asking for a contact name, question and favorite response method. Then configure the platform to send an email containing this information outside of the platform or slack channel. The team members will be capable of instantaneously access the ticket through your CRM or Slack ID and response appropriately.

The variable @flow.first_name refers to the contact name if you get it on the previous step, while @flow.order and @flow.favorite_channel refer the contact order and the way that you want to get the response (SMS, Call, Email), respectively. Notice that, if the field "Name" is from a filled contact, you can replace @flow.name to @contact.name or @contact.first_name.
