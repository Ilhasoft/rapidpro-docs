- In “keyword” you can define a word to works as a keyword;
- In “trigger when”, you will choose between two options: 
- The message starts with the keyword: If the phrase typed for the user starts with a keyword, the chosen flow will trigger;
- The message contains only the keyword: The chosen flow will trigger if the user type just the keyword;
- In “Flow”, is defined the flow that will start when you use the keyword;
- In “Only groups”, is possible to apply the rules from this trigger to specific contact groups, just leave the blank space if you want to apply this rule to all user.
