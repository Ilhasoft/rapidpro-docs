Triggers allow you to control your flows, defining when and how they will be started. A flow can be triggered by a contact when starting a conversation and a lot more. Let's talk about the most common trigger type, **Keywords**.

Click **Create a message keyword that launches a flow** to start.

- On *keyword* you will set the word to work as a trigger;
- At *trigger when* you will choose between: 
  - *Message starts with the keyword* - If the phrase typed for the user starts with the keyword, the chosen flow will take action;
  - *Message contains only the keyword* - The chosen flow will take action if the user types only the sigle keyword set;
- On *Flow* is set the flow to be started;
- On *Only groups*, is possible to apply the rules from this trigger to specific contact's groups, just leave the blank space if you want to apply this rule to everyone.

An usecase is starting a welcome flow when a person sends "hello" to be registered into the organization and become a contact, as the picture:
