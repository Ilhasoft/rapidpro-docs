When a contact sends a message that corresponds to a keyword set to launch a flow, he will be automatically placed into this flow by default. This means that if your contact is placed within a flow A and he sends a message containing a keyword that starts a flow B, he will be moved from flow A to flow B.
This is useful in situations you want to permit your contacts to move between flows using keywords. 

If you want to keep your contacts in a flow until they finish or it expires, you can configure your flow to ignore the keyword until your contacts have left the previous flow.
