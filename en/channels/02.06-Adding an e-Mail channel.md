# Channel intro

Besides sending messages using customized e-mail accounts, it's possible to set an e-mail address as a channel. That way it would work with the flow as any other channel with no need to use special actionsets.

That's an exclusive feature, available only on [Push](https://push.ilhasoft.mobi).

## Set it up

At the same session where other channels can be added, you'll find an option to add the e-mail channel.

Similar to connecting an e-mail account to an e-mail client, you'll need to set the connection parameters as seen below.

After that, just click **Submit** and the channel will be added.

## Example

With the email channel, you can centralize your chats and use the same Flow's messages and actions to reply to your audience. If necessary you can sort contacts by the channel name using the expression @channel.name
