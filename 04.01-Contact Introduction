Making reference to a contact in the flow

There are two ways to make a reference to the contacts fields into the flow: 

@contact- reference the contact that is receiving the message. On most of the cases, this is an active contact. When you use “Send a Message to Someone”, @contact refer to the contact or group that the message is sent. 
@Step.contact- reference the contact that sends the last message processed by the flow. In most cases, this is also an active contact. To use the “Send an SMS Response”, @step.contact and @contact are the same contacts. To use the  “Send a Message to Someone”, @step.contact refer to the contact that received a message to the “Send a Message to Someone” into the flow, through triggers.

INSERT A PRINT

As the message created by “Send a Message to Someone Else” was sent to Nelson RapidPro, @contact.first_name will be replaced for Nelson. @step.contact.name and @step.contact.tel will be replaced for the user name and phone number that needs support.
