**1. Name**

The given name to the created flow.

**2. Create Message**

This button opens the steps editors, that comprehends two distinct dialogs: The action dialog (Send Message) and the split dialog (Wait for response). In general, we recommend starting a flow with a Send Message action, but you can find a more apropriated rule set.

Actions Editor
The actions editor starts with the action Send Message, although you can click on the drop-down menu to alter a lot of actions dialogs. To access the split editor, click on the ramification icon on the top right of the action editor.

Split Editor
The split editor allows you to create articulation points in your flow on the form of conditionals declarators. As explained in our introductory page, the rules editor is composed by:
1.A type of value -  “When someone is on this flow point…”
2.Responses rules that evaluated the type of selected value - “If the message response…”
3.The specifics values that you are evaluating for
4.The categories that the correspondents values to response rules are located.
5.The given name to the resulted variable.

**3. Simulator**

The simulator is a tool for you test your flows as a final user. When clicked, the simulator will start the first step on your flow.
